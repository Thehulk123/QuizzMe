# QuizzMe
Hey there!

Created my first android app using Java. As the name suggests, it is indeed a quiz application created just for fun and knowledge.
It is a true and false game. For each Correct answer, player is rewarded +10 pts and for each Incorrect answer 5 points are deducted(i.e -5).

The android application uses Volley Library and JSON as an API.
I have also used some animations in this app. For every correct answer there is a fading animation using green light and for every wrong answer there is a shaking animation using a red color impliying the answer is incorrect.

I have used Shared Preferences as a means of storing high scores and the state at the backend.
For instance, if the player pauses or exits the app and comes back, he/she will be able to resume from that question where he had left.

Finally, I have also created an app icon for my app using ImageAssets functionality of android studio.

Languages Used: Java, XML.

Things learnt : XML, JSON, Shared Preferences, Volley Library, Use of Singleton.
